# MoTask Project Summary & Next Steps

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**MoTask** is a modern, cutting-edge todo list application designed with a focus on essential functionality, clean user experience, and robust architecture. The project follows a comprehensive 4-week development roadmap with detailed planning and documentation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Design Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (for optimal performance)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for rapid, consistent development)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight and efficient)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

### Architecture Principles
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive across all devices
2. **Security-First**: Row Level Security and proper authentication
3. **Performance-Optimized**: Code splitting, lazy loading, optimized bundles
4. **Accessibility-Compliant**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. **Real-time Synchronization**: Instant updates across sessions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps - Implementation Phase

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Initialize React Project**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/molder-34/MoTask.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup with comprehensive documentation"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Configure Development Environment**
   - Install and configure ESLint, Prettier, Husky
   - Set up Tailwind CSS
   - Configure TypeScript strict mode

### Week 1 Priorities (Foundation)
1. **Project Infrastructure** (Days 1-2)
   - Complete Vite + React + TypeScript setup
   - Configure development tools and linting
   - Set up basic project structure

2. **Supabase Setup** (Days 3-4)
   - Create Supabase project
   - Implement database schema
   - Set up authentication system

3. **Core UI Components** (Days 5-7)
   - Build design system components
   - Implement responsive layout
   - Create navigation system

### Development Workflow
1. **Daily Standups**: Review progress and blockers
2. **Feature Branches**: Use Git flow for all features
3. **Code Reviews**: Self-review before commits
4. **Testing**: Write tests alongside features
5. **Documentation**: Update docs as features evolve

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### Technical Milestones
